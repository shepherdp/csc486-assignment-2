# main function, you may want to comment out the functions you are not currently
# using so they are not running each time you modify the code.

    close6 = nx.closeness_centrality(G6)

    # A handy way to get the values from a dictionary as a 1D list.

    # random graph are on the left, all small world scores are in the middle,
    # and all scale free scores are on the right.  These lists are just meant
    # to hold the x-values of each score so that we can plot them together.

    # Finally, we can use the function plt.scatter(x, y), where x and y are
    # either numbers or lists of numbers, and are the coordinates of the points
    # to plot.  In other words, to plot three points, one at (1, 3), one at
    # (2, 4), and one at (6, 5), you would call
    # plt.scatter( [1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5] )
    
    # You can call plt.scatter as many times as you like before displaying the
    # plot, and each call will place dots on the screen of a different color.
    # Since there are three calls made below, the dots on the plot show up in
    # three differently colored groups.
    plt.scatter(x4, y4)
    plt.scatter(x5, y5)
    plt.scatter(x6, y6)

    # Once you have plotted all your points, call plt.show() to display the plot.
